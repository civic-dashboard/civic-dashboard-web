    <h1>Deputations Wiki</h1>
<h2>What are Deputations?</h2>
<p>Deputations are short speeches, lasting between 3-5 minutes, made by citizens to influence the decision making of the City Council Committees on a given issue or recommendation. Members of the public can register to speak, or &quot;depute&quot;, on a specific topic at meetings of Committees, sub-committees and community councils. Public deputations make up part of the public record of the meeting, and allow for citizens to voice their views and concerns on agenda items directly to decision makers within the City.</p>
<h2>Who can make a deputation?</h2>
<p>Anyone can make a deputation - it is your right as a constituent! Deputations can be made by individuals, groups or representatives of organisations, provided they register their intention to make a public presentation with the Clerk in advance. Experts, organisations, groups or individuals may also be invited to speak by Committees. Citizen engagement is an important part of making City Council work effectively - if you feel strongly about an item, deputations are a great way to make your voice heard!</p>
<h2>How do I register to make a deputation?</h2>
<p>Anyone who wants to make a deputation can do so by registering a notice of their intention with the Committee clerk. The contact information of a committee clerk can be found on the committee&#39;s website, or on the City of Toronto schedule. The request can be made by regular mail, e-mail, fax, telephone, or in person, and must be received no later than 4:30pm on the business day immediately before the committee meeting (though some are more lenient).</p>
<p>The request should include your name, telephone number and email address, and should specify the agenda item on which you wish to make your deputation. You should also indicate if you will require a translator, and whether you intend to appear in person or by video conference.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve created this template to help you get started!</p>
<h2>Deputations/Speaking At Committee 101</h2>
<p>Speaking at a committee can feel a little intimidating at first, but it&#39;s an impactful way to make your voice heard on issues you care about! It is a very clear and powerful signal to your elected representatives that you, and likely others, care about this issue and what they do about it. Here&#39;s what you need to know to come in prepared and confident.</p>
<h2>What Should I Expect?</h2>
<p>Committee meetings are fairly simple! The room will be composed of the committee members, City staff, and members of the public like yourself. The committee members - mostly city councillors, sometimes appointed members of the public - go through agenda items one by one, each one with roughly the following process:</p>
<ol>
<li>The item is introduced</li>
<li>Signed up speakers (that&#39;s you!) speak/depute one by one for 3-5 minutes - committee members may ask follow up questions</li>
<li>The committee discusses the item, ask questions of staff, discuss and vote on any amendments they might have</li>
<li>The committee votes on whether to adopt, not adopt, or defer (send back to City staff for further work) the item</li>
<li>Next item!</li>
</ol>
<p>If a committee has a full day of items, they&#39;ll often break for lunch in the afternoon and resume afterwards. Most of the major committees have their meetings streamed and recorded via the City Council YouTube channel - check it out to get a picture of what goes on!</p>
