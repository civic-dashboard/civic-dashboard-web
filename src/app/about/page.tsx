            <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-6">Why We Exist</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              In brief, we&apos;re regular Torontonians who believe:
            </p>
            <ul className="space-y-4 mb-8">
              <li>
                Finding out what is happening that is relevant to you in your
                local (municipal/provincial) government and what you can do
                about it should be universally accessible.
              </li>
              <li>
                A democracy is only democratic if it&apos;s accessible, and ours
                currently isn&apos;t for the vast majority of its residents.
              </li>
              <li>
                A more engaged democracy is a more representative and effective
                one.
              </li>
              <li>
                Democratic engagement should be a clear, actionable, meaningful,
                and satisfying response to wanting to see a change in the place
                you live. It should be at least as good an option as stewing in
                frustration, or ranting to a friend, or tweeting, or just plain
                old apathy.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div className="space-y-6">
              <p>
                We think that people care a lot, they just aren&apos;t given the
                right tools to translate that passion into democratic
                engagement. We believe a more accessible, lower-friction
                democracy will be adopted more widely, will be more
                representative of our city&apos;s population and its desires,
                will be engaged with far more often than just during elections,
                and will contribute to a more bought-in, people-centric, and
                flourishing city - and that that&apos;s worth working on.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lastly, we believe that a small group of humble, ambitious,
                curious, hopeful, collaborative, and coordinated volunteers can
                make meaningful strides towards a more democratic Toronto.

                We&apos;re not for profit - no one is making money off of this,
                and no one ever will. This is made by people who care and come
                together, so that people can more easily care and come together,

                We keep costs low, we use volunteer labour, and we are
                thoughtful and self-critical about the pressures and incentives
                we exist under. We&apos;re building this as long-term critical
                public infrastructure - thoughtfully, prioritizing public input
                and stability, and without profit in mind.
              </li>
              <li>
                We&apos;re 100% volunteer driven - and we welcome all
