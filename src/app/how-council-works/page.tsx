            City staff, working at City Hall, take the first steps in acting on
            an item by researching and developing recommendations. They gather
            data, analyze what other cities are doing, and propose specific
            actions for Toronto. This stage is the most time-intensive, as staff
            prepare detailed reports that lay the groundwork for future

            Committees review the staff&apos;s recommendations, provide
            feedback, suggest changes, and ask critical questions to ensure the
            proposals are well thought out. While committees don&apos;t make
            final decisions, they refine the item and send it to the full
            Council for voting.
            <br />
            <br />
            This stage also provides an opportunity for public deputations,

            Finally, the item reaches the full City Council, which consists of
            all elected council members. At this stage, councilors review the
            item, debate its merits, and vote on whether to approve or reject
            it. Each councilor casts a voteâ€”green for approval, red for
            rejection. If a majority votes in favor, the item becomes a new law,
            policy, or directive for the city.

            <span className="font-bold">Call or Email Your Councillor</span>
            <br />
            You can call or email your local councillor to discuss issues you
            care about. Councillors can advocate on your behalf and provide
            insights into ongoing city decisions.

            <span className="font-bold">Attend a Consultation</span>
            <br />
            City staff often hold consultations, surveys, or community meetings
            to gather feedback on new policies and projects. These are great
            opportunities to share your thoughts early in the process.

            <br />
            At the committee stage, you can make a deputation, which is a formal
            presentation where you share your views directly with council
            members during a public meeting. Your public comments can influence
            the proposal under review before it reaches City Council, or be
            taken into consideration for future proposals.

            <br />
            <span className="font-bold">Submit a Comment</span>
            <br />
            At the committee stage, you can also make a comment on each agenda
            item that is being considered. Your comments can influence the
            members of the committee as they make their decisions.
