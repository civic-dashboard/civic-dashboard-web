                In April 2025, the city councillor for Ward 25 Scarborough-Rouge
                Park, Jennifer McKelvie was elected as a Member of Parliament in
                Ajax, Ontario in the 2025 Canadian Federal Election. As a
                result, she resigned from her position as City Councillor and
                the Toronto City Council declared the office of Councillor for
                Ward 25 vacant, opting to hold a <strong>by-election</strong> to
                fill the position.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Ward 25 By-Election will be held on September 29th. The
                elected Councillor will hold the office for the remainder of the
                current <strong>City Council term</strong>, until the{' '}
                <strong>municipal elections</strong> on October 26th, 2026.

                You will need to be on the <strong>Voters' List</strong> to vote
                in the by-election, but you do not need to register in advance.
                However, there are several reasons why registration on the

                tool. This is particularly important if your name or address has
                recently changed. Ensuring your information is correct on the
                Voters' List before you vote will allow for a smoother check-in
                at the voting place and will reduce the risk of unnecessary

              <p>
                Additionally, registering on the Voters' List will give you
                access to a <strong>voter information card</strong>, which will
                provide information on where to vote and will lead to a faster

                <strong>before September 4th, 2025</strong>, your voter
                information card will be mailed to you. If you register your
                details after this date, you will be able to access a digital
                voter information card through the MyVote website. It is
                important to note that the voter information card is{' '}
                <strong>not a valid form of identification</strong> for the
                by-election.

                There are lots of ways to stay engaged with City Council in your

                Council outside of election time is easier than you might think,

                understanding and engaging with City Council more accessible for

              </h3>
              <p>
                City staff often hold consultations, surveys, or community
                meetings to gather feedback on new policies and projects. These
                are open to all and are great opportunities to share your
                thoughts early in the decision-making process. The City lists

              </h3>
              <p>
                At the committee stage, members of the public can choose to
                share their thoughts directly on an agenda item. You can choose
                to submit a written comment expressing your thoughts to the
                committee, or you can make a deputation, which is a formal
                presentation where you share your view directly with council
                members during a public meeting. Your public comments can
                influence the proposal under review before it reaches City
                Council, or be taken into consideration for future proposals. To
                see upcoming agenda items that you might want to share your
