# Deputations

## What are Deputations?

Deputations are short speeches, lasting between 3-5 minutes, made by citizens to influence the decision making of the City Council Committees on a given issue or recommendation. Members of the public can register to speak, or "depute", on a specific topic at meetings of Committees, sub-committees and community councils. Public deputations make up part of the public record of the meeting, and allow for citizens to voice their views and concerns on agenda items directly to decision makers within the City.

## Who can make a deputation?

Anyone can make a deputation - it is your right as a constituent! Deputations can be made by individuals, groups or representatives of organisations, provided they register their intention to make a public presentation with the Clerk in advance. Experts, organisations, groups or individuals may also be invited to speak by Committees. Citizen engagement is an important part of making City Council work effectively - if you feel strongly about an item, deputations are a great way to make your voice heard!

## How do I register to make a deputation?

Anyone who wants to make a deputation can do so by registering a notice of their intention with the Committee clerk. The contact information of a committee clerk can be found on the committee's website, or on the [City of Toronto schedule](https://secure.toronto.ca/council/#/meetingSchedule). The request can be made by regular mail, e-mail, fax, telephone, or in person, and must be received no later than 4:30pm on the business day immediately before the committee meeting (though some are more lenient).

The request should include your name, telephone number and email address, and should specify the agenda item on which you wish to make your deputation. You should also indicate if you will require a translator, and whether you intend to appear in person or by video conference.

We've created a template below to help you get started!

## Deputations/Speaking At Committee 101

Speaking at a committee can feel a little intimidating at first, but it's an impactful way to make your voice heard on issues you care about! It is a very clear and powerful signal to your elected representatives that you, and likely others, care about this issue and what they do about it. Here's what you need to know to come in prepared and confident.

## What Should I Expect?

Committee meetings are fairly simple! The room will be composed of the committee members, City staff, and members of the public like yourself. The committee members - mostly city councillors, sometimes appointed members of the public - go through agenda items one by one, each one with roughly the following process:

1. The item is introduced
2. Signed up speakers (that's you!) speak/depute one by one for 3-5 minutes - committee members may ask follow up questions
3. The committee discusses the item, ask questions of staff, discuss and vote on any amendments they might have
4. The committee votes on whether to adopt, not adopt, or defer (send back to City staff for further work) the item
5. Next item!

If a committee has a full day of items, they'll often break for lunch in the afternoon and resume afterwards. Most of the major committees have their meetings streamed and recorded via the [City Council YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/TorontoCityCouncilLive) - check it out to get a picture of what goes on!

## When Will I Be Speaking?

Unfortunately, it's hard to say! The short answer is to be available from ~9:30am to 4pm the day of your deputation - but here are some tools you can use to better estimate when you will be speaking!

That said, items sometimes change order on the day, so it's best to be at or near the committee meeting location if you're speaking in person.

Whether you're speaking online or in person, you can keep track of the meeting to know when you're speaking by either streaming it live on the City Council YouTube channel or using the [Meeting Monitor](https://secure.toronto.ca/council/#/monitor) on the City's website.

## Where Do I Go If I'm Speaking In Person?

Most committees meet and give residents the opportunity to speak both in person and online! However, some committees only meet and hear speakers via video conference - those committees are listed under "Video Conference Only" below.

Most in-person meetings are held in a committee room on the second floor of [City Hall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B4yv2v3nQ9Hc9EPq8)! Check the list below to see whether the committee you're speaking to meets elsewhere.

## Can I Make My Deputation Remotely?

Yes! When registering to make a deputation, you can choose whether to make your presentation in person via video conference. If you sign up to speak via video conference, you will be emailed a video conference link by the morning of the committee meeting, along with login instructions. Online participation takes place via Webex, which can be joined by telephone, computer, tablet or smartphone.

If you have never used Webex before, it is wise to familarise yourself with the software before your deputation, to limit the impact of any technical difficulties. You can use [this link](https://www.webex.com/test-meeting.html) to test Webex meetings on your device, and you can find additional information on joining and participating in online meetings, including tips and troubleshooting advice, [here](https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/pdf/Participating-in-Electronic-Meetings-Mar2022.pdf).

Give yourself 10 minutes of buffer to make sure you're in the meeting and to not be caught off guard in case the speakers before you are absent! Then speak as you would normally. You can even have your notes loaded up on your screen to help you out!


## What Should I Say?

You can say whatever you'd like, as long as it's relevant to the item you're speaking about! There's no one correct way to engage with democracy. That said, your message is likely to be more impactful if you are clear about who you are, what you want, and why you want it.

If you're not sure how to phrase your comments, try the following simple format to get started!

Who you are - name, where you live (if relevant), relevant communities you're part of
Your relationship to the item - why do you care about it? How does it affect you? Why do you think it's important?
What you want - what would you like this committee to do? Do you want them to vote yes or no on this item? Do you want them to amend/change it in some way?



## Deputation Template:

Hi there!

My name is Jasmine Michaels, I'm a 20-year resident of the High Park neighbourhood, and I'm a lifelong birder and animal lover.

This item is meant to protect wildlife, yet it will greatly increase the level of noise in High Park, which scares and disorients birds, damages the ecosystem, and makes the park less enjoyable for everyone! Parks are about bringing people and nature together - this does the opposite.

I ask that this committee either vote No, or find an amendment that does not increase the park's noise level. My family, my birding group, and I will be following your actions closely!

Sincerely,
Jasmine Michaels

## Final Thoughts

While it can be intimidating at first, taking the time to prepare your presentation in advance will give your deputation structure and clarity, and will make your presentation more persuasive to the committee. Making a deputation isn't for everyone, but hearing and taking on feedback from residents and communities is a vital part of the City's decision-making process. If you feel strongly about an issue, there is no better way to advocate for the change you want to see.
