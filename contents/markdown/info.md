# City Council

Toronto City Council is the decision-making body for the City of Toronto. It's made up of elected officials who vote on policies, laws, and initiatives that impact the city. These decisions affect everything from local parks to public transit and housing. See "Division of Powers" for more information about what municipal governments do!

## Legislative and Executive Body

City Council is unique in the Canadian political landscape in that it is both a legislative and executive body. That means City Council does both executive work (hiring staff, directing staff to undertake certain work, overseeing the implementation of policy etc.) and legislative work (passing laws etc.) In the federal and provincial governments, these two functions of government are separate.

## City Council Elections

Every four years, new councillors are elected. Elections can happen more frequently if there is a councillor vacancy that needs to be filled (e.g. if the councillor resigns).

## City Council Terms

Toronto's City Council terms are four years long, after which elections are held to elect new Councillors across the city. The current term began on November 15, 2022, and will end on November 14, 2026.

## (The lack of) Partisanship in Toronto Politics

In Ontario, there are 4 major political parties: the NDP, Conservative, Liberal and Green party. In Toronto, councillors are not formally associated with political parties. Their policies and goals may still, however, align closely with certain parties. The Municipal Elections Act explicitly prohibits political parties within local municipal elections in Ontario.

## Size of Council (Current and Historical)

City Council is made up of 25 Councillors and one Mayor. Prior to September 2018, there were 47 Councillors on Council. The Provincial Ontario Government passed the Better Local Government Act (2018), reducing the number of wards and the size of Council to 25.

# Division of Powers

When advocating for issues you care about, it is important to know which level of government has the authority to control or influence that issue. This is known as the "Division of Powers" in Canada. The Constitution assigns certain powers to federal (section 91) and provincial governments (section 92). Some examples include:

## Powers of the Canadian (Federal) Government

- Federal Taxation
- Regulation of Trade/Commerce
- Postal Service
- Census/Statistics
- National Defence
- Navigation/Shipping
- Currency/Coinage
- Banking/Incorporation of Banks/Paper Money
- Citizenship
- Marriage/Divorce
- Criminal law, including Criminal Procedure

## Powers of the Ontario (Provincial) Government

- Provincial Taxation
- Prisons
- Hospitals
- Municipalities
- Property and Civil Rights
- Administration of Civil/Criminal Justice
- Education
- Natural Resources

## Powers of the City of Toronto

It is important to note that the Constitution does not assign powers to municipalities. Municipalities are granted powers from the provincial governments they fall under, and provincial governments retain the right to give or take away municipal powers.

Many of Toronto's powers are formalized in provincial legislation, such as the **City of Toronto Act, 2006**. Since January 1, 2007, when the Act came into force, the City of Toronto has had the power to pass a wide array of by-laws relating to economic, social and environmental issues within the city. This includes the power to enact bylaws relating to the City's financial affairs, roads and business licensing, as well as certain zoning and tax regulations.

The City's responsibilities also include water treatment, parks, libraries, garbage collection, public transit, land use planning, traffic signals, police, paramedics, fire services, sewers, homeless shelters, childcare, recreation centres and more.

For additional information on the City of Toronto Act and similar legislation, please visit [this link](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/06c11).

# Wards

Toronto is divided into 25 geographic areas, each represented by a City Councillor. These areas are called 'wards.' Residents living in each ward elect one councillor to represent the area in Municipal elections, which occur every four years. The next municipal election will be on October 26, 2026 - see the "Elections" section for more information.

You can figure out what ward you live in by inputting your address here: [Ward Profiles â€“ City of Toronto](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/neighbourhoods-communities/ward-profiles/).

# Councillors

A Councillor is an elected official who represents a specific ward in Toronto. Councillors are responsible for voicing the concerns of their constituents, debating issues, and voting on decisions that shape the city's policies and laws.

Councillors talk to residents, businesses and community groups about City programs and services and listen to their concerns. Councillors:

- Attend City Council and committee meetings
- Sit on the boards of City agencies and corporations
- Propose changes to the decisions City Council makes
- Introduce motions to propose action or raise awareness of issues
- Hold or attend community meetings to get input from the public
- Host or get involved in community events
- Help people access City services

Councillors wear two hats: they are working in the best interests of the city, as well as the best interests of their constituents.

You can find a list of current City Councillors, along with details of their voting records, on our Councillors page.

## City Councillor Offices and Staff

Each City Councillor has a team of staff who support them in their constituent and political work. These include assistants focused on constituency outreach and events, policy research, communications and administrative support. Councillors have physical offices located at City Hall, and many also have constituency offices located within their local communities. To find your Councillor's contact address, you can check their profile on the City Website.

# Municipal Elections

## Municipalities

Municipalities are local governments (cities, towns, villages, townships, or counties) with elected Councillors and a Mayor. Ontario has 444 municipalities, managing local roads, waste, transit, zoning and libraries.

## Municipal Elections

City Councillors are elected in Municipal elections, which take place every four years on the fourth Monday in October. The next Municipal election will take place on **October 26, 2026**. Municipal elections take place on the same date across Ontario, when Councillors will be elected in Municipalities across the province.

Ontario's Municipal Elections use a "first-past-the-post" system, in which the candidate with the most votes is elected, and all other votes do not result in representation.

## By-Elections

By-elections are held to fill vacancies on City Council that occur between general elections. Vacancies can occur due to a member's resignation, death, ineligibility to sit, or expulsion from their post.

A by-election to fill the vacancy of Councillor for Ward 25, Scarborough-Rouge Park was held at the end of September 2025, where Neethan Shan was elected Councillor. He replaced Jennifer McKelvie, who was elected as a Member of Parliament in Ajax, Ontario in the 2025 Canadian Federal Election. As a result, Neethan Shan will hold the office for the remainder of the current City Council term, until the municipal elections on October 26th, 2026.

## Election Contribution Rebate Program

The Contribution Rebate Program is available for people who contribute money to councillor or mayoral candidates in any election or by-election. The program allows contributors to receive a portion of their contribution(s) back.

The amount of money that a contributor is eligible to receive is based on the total amount of money they contributed to all candidates participating in the program. For example, if a contributor gave three different candidates `$`500 each, their rebate is based on a total contribution of `$`1,500. See the "Rebate Amounts and Formula" section for examples of rebate calculations.

## Voters' List

The Voter's List is a list of the name, address and date of birth of all eligible voters across Ontario. It is used by election staff to verify whether voters are eligible to vote in a given election or by-election.

# Deputations

## What are Deputations?

Deputations are short speeches, lasting between 3-5 minutes, made by citizens to influence the decision-making of the City Council Committees on a given issue or recommendation. Members of the public can register to speak, or "depute", on a specific topic at meetings of Committees, sub-committees and community councils. Public deputations make up part of the public record of the meeting, and allow for citizens to voice their views and concerns on agenda items directly to decision makers within the City.

## Who can make a deputation?

Anyone can make a deputation - it is your right as a constituent! Deputations can be made by individuals, groups or representatives of organisations, provided they register their intention to make a public presentation with the Clerk in advance. Experts, organisations, groups or individuals may also be invited to speak by Committees. Citizen engagement is an important part of making City Council work effectively - if you feel strongly about an item, deputations are a great way to make your voice heard!

## How do I register to make a deputation?

Anyone who wants to make a deputation can do so by registering a notice of their intention with the Committee clerk. The contact information of a committee clerk can be found on the committee's website, or on the City of Toronto schedule. The request can be made by regular mail, e-mail, fax, telephone, or in person, and must be received no later than 4:30pm on the business day immediately before the committee meeting (though some are more lenient).

The request should include your name, telephone number and email address, and should specify the agenda item on which you wish to make your deputation. You should also indicate if you will require a translator, and whether you intend to appear in person or by video conference.

We've created this template to help you get started!

# Deputations/Speaking At Committee 101

Speaking at a committee can feel a little intimidating at first, but it's an impactful way to make your voice heard on issues you care about! It is a very clear and powerful signal to your elected representatives that you, and likely others, care about this issue and what they do about it. Here's what you need to know to come in prepared and confident.

## What Should I Expect?

Committee meetings are fairly simple! The room will be composed of the committee members, City staff, and members of the public like yourself. The committee members - mostly city councillors, sometimes appointed members of the public - go through agenda items one by one, each one with roughly the following process:

1. The item is introduced
2. Signed up speakers (that's you!) speak/depute one by one for 3-5 minutes - committee members may ask follow up questions
3. The committee discusses the item, ask questions of staff, discuss and vote on any amendments they might have
4. The committee votes on whether to adopt, not adopt, or defer (send back to City staff for further work) the item
5. Next item!

If a committee has a full day of items, they'll often break for lunch in the afternoon and resume afterwards. Most of the major committees have their meetings streamed and recorded via the [City Council YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CityofToronto) - check it out to get a picture of what goes on!

## When Will I Be Speaking?

Unfortunately, it's hard to say! The short answer is to be available from ~9:30am to 4pm the day of your deputation - but here are some tools you can use to better estimate when you will be speaking!

That said, items sometimes change order on the day, so it's best to be at or near the committee meeting location if you're speaking in person.

Whether you're speaking online or in person, you can keep track of the meeting to know when you're speaking by either streaming it live on the City Council YouTube channel or using the Meeting Monitor on the City's website.

## Where Do I Go If I'm Speaking In Person?

Most committees meet and give residents the opportunity to speak both in person and online! However, some committees only meet and hear speakers via video conference - those committees are listed under "Video Conference Only" below.

Most in-person meetings are held in a committee room on the second floor of City Hall! Check the list below to see whether the committee you're speaking to meets elsewhere.

## Can I Make My Deputation Remotely?

Yes! When registering to make a deputation, you can choose whether to make your presentation in person via video conference. If you sign up to speak via video conference, you will be emailed a video conference link by the morning of the committee meeting, along with login instructions. Online participation takes place via Webex, which can be joined by telephone, computer, tablet or smartphone.

If you have never used Webex before, it is wise to familiarise yourself with the software before your deputation, to limit the impact of any technical difficulties. You can use [this link](https://www.webex.com/test-meeting.html) to test Webex meetings on your device, and you can find additional information on joining and participating in online meetings, including tips and troubleshooting advice, here.

Give yourself 10 minutes of buffer to make sure you're in the meeting and to not be caught off guard in case the speakers before you are absent! Then speak as you would normally. You can even have your notes loaded up on your screen to help you out!

## What Should I Say?

You can say whatever you'd like, as long as it's relevant to the item you're speaking about! There's no one correct way to engage with democracy. That said, your message is likely to be more impactful if you are clear about who you are, what you want, and why you want it.

If you're not sure how to phrase your comments, try the following simple format to get started!

1. **Who you are** - name, where you live (if relevant), relevant communities you're part of
2. **Your relationship to the item** - why do you care about it? How does it affect you? Why do you think it's important?
3. **What you want** - what would you like this committee to do? Do you want them to vote yes or no on this item? Do you want them to amend/change it in some way?

### Example

> Hi there!
>
> My name is Jasmine Michaels, I'm a 20 year resident of the High Park neighbourhood, and I'm a lifelong birder and animal lover.
>
> This item is meant to protect wildlife, yet it will greatly increase the level of noise in High Park, which scares and disorients birds, damages the ecosystem, and makes the park less enjoyable for everyone! Parks are about bringing people and nature together - this does the opposite.
>
> I ask that this committee either vote No, or find an amendment that does not increase the park's noise level. My family, my birding group and I will be following your actions closely!
>
> Sincerely,
> Jasmine Michaels

While it can be intimidating at first, taking the time to prepare your presentation in advance will give your deputation structure and clarity, and will make your presentation more persuasive to the committee. Making a deputation isn't for everyone, but hearing and taking on feedback from residents and communities is vital part of the City's decision making process. If you feel strongly about an issue, there is no better way to advocate for the change you want to see.
