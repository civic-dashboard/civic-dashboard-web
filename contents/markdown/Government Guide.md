# City of Toronto Government Guide
# City Council

Toronto City Council is the decision-making body for the City of Toronto. It's made up of elected officials who vote on policies, laws, and initiatives that impact the city. These decisions affect everything from local parks to public transit and housing. See "Division of Powers" for more information about what municipal governments do!

## Legislative and Executive Body

City Council is unique in the Canadian political landscape in that it is both a legislative and executive body. That means City Council does both executive work (hiring staff, directing staff to undertake certain work, overseeing the implementation of policy etc.) and legislative work (passing laws etc.) In the federal and provincial governments, these two functions of government are separate.

## City Council Elections

Every four years, new councillors are elected. Elections can happen more frequently if there is a councillor vacancy that needs to be filled (e.g. if the councillor resigns).

## City Council Terms

Toronto's City Council terms are four years long, after which elections are held to elect new Councillors across the city. The current term began on November 15, 2022, and will end on November 14, 2026.

## (The lack of) Partisanship in Toronto Politics

In Ontario, there are 4 major political parties: the NDP, Conservative, Liberal and Green party. In Toronto, councillors are not formally associated with political parties. Their policies and goals may still, however, align closely with certain parties. The Municipal Elections Act explicitly prohibits political parties within local municipal elections in Ontario.

## Size of Council (Current and Historical)

City Council is made up of 25 Councillors and one Mayor. Prior to September 2018, there were 47 Councillors on Council. The Provincial Ontario Government passed the Better Local Government Act (2018), reducing the number of wards and the size of Council to 25.

# Division of Powers

When advocating for issues you care about, it is important to know which level of government has the authority to control or influence that issue. This is known as the "Division of Powers" in Canada. The Constitution assigns certain powers to federal (section 91) and provincial governments (section 92). Some examples include:

## Powers of the Canadian (Federal) Government

- Federal Taxation
- Regulation of Trade/Commerce
- Postal Service
- Census/Statistics
- National Defence
- Navigation/Shipping
- Currency/Coinage
- Banking/Incorporation of Banks/Paper Money
- Citizenship
- Marriage/Divorce
- Criminal law, including Criminal Procedure

## Powers of the Ontario (Provincial) Government

- Provincial Taxation
- Prisons
- Hospitals
- Municipalities
- Property and Civil Rights
- Administration of Civil/Criminal Justice
- Education
- Natural Resources

## Powers of the City of Toronto

It is important to note that the Constitution does not assign powers to municipalities. Municipalities are granted powers from the provincial governments they fall under, and provincial governments retain the right to give or take away municipal powers.

Many of Toronto's powers are formalized in provincial legislation, such as the **City of Toronto Act, 2006**. Since January 1, 2007, when the Act came into force, the City of Toronto has had the power to pass a wide array of by-laws relating to economic, social and environmental issues within the city. This includes the power to enact bylaws relating to the City's financial affairs, roads and business licensing, as well as certain zoning and tax regulations.

The City's responsibilities also include water treatment, parks, libraries, garbage collection, public transit, land use planning, traffic signals, police, paramedics, fire services, sewers, homeless shelters, childcare, recreation centres and more.

# Wards

Toronto is divided into 25 geographic areas, each represented by a City Councillor. These areas are called 'wards.' Residents living in each ward elect one councillor to represent the area in Municipal elections, which occur every four years. The next municipal election will be on October 26, 2026 - see the "Elections" section for more information.

You can figure out what ward you live in by inputting your address here: [Ward Profiles â€“ City of Toronto](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/neighbourhoods-communities/ward-profiles/).

# Councillors

A Councillor is an elected official who represents a specific ward in Toronto. Councillors are responsible for voicing the concerns of their constituents, debating issues, and voting on decisions that shape the city's policies and laws.

Councillors talk to residents, businesses and community groups about City programs and services and listen to their concerns. Councillors:

- Attend City Council and committee meetings
- Sit on the boards of City agencies and corporations
- Propose changes to the decisions City Council makes
- Introduce motions to propose action or raise awareness of issues
- Hold or attend community meetings to get input from the public
- Host or get involved in community events
- Help people access City services

Councillors wear two hats: they are working in the best interests of the city, as well as the best interests of their constituents.

You can find a list of current City Councillors, along with details of their voting records, on our Councillors page.

## City Councillor Offices and Staff

Each City Councillor has a team of staff who support them in their constituent and political work. These include assistants focused on constituency outreach and events, policy research, communications and administrative support. Councillors have physical offices located at City Hall, and many also have constituency offices located within their local communities. To find your Councillor's contact address, you can check their profile on the City Website.

# Municipal Elections

## Municipalities

Municipalities are local governments (cities, towns, villages, townships, or counties) with elected Councillors and a Mayor. Ontario has 444 municipalities, managing local roads, waste, transit, zoning and libraries.

## Municipal Elections

City Councillors are elected in Municipal elections, which take place every four years on the fourth Monday in October. The next Municipal election will take place on **October 26, 2026**. Municipal elections take place on the same date across Ontario, when Councillors will be elected in Municipalities across the province.

Ontario's Municipal Elections use a "first-past-the-post" system, in which the candidate with the most votes is elected, and all other votes do not result in representation.

## By-Elections

By-elections are held to fill vacancies on City Council that occur between general elections. Vacancies can occur due to a member's resignation, death, ineligibility to sit, or expulsion from their post.

A by-election to fill the vacancy of Councillor for Ward 25, Scarborough-Rouge Park was held at the end of September 2025, where Neethan Shan was elected Councillor. He replaced Jennifer McKelvie, who was elected as a Member of Parliament in Ajax, Ontario in the 2025 Canadian Federal Election. As a result, Neethan Shan will hold the office for the remainder of the current City Council term, until the municipal elections on October 26th, 2026.

## Election Contribution Rebate Program

The Contribution Rebate Program is available for people who contribute money to councillor or mayoral candidates in any election or by-election. The program allows contributors to receive a portion of their contribution(s) back.

The amount of money that a contributor is eligible to receive is based on the total amount of money they contributed to all candidates participating in the program. For example, if a contributor gave three different candidates `$`500 each, their rebate is based on a total contribution of `$`1,500. See the "Rebate Amounts and Formula" section for examples of rebate calculations.

## Voters' List

The Voter's List is a list of the name, address and date of birth of all eligible voters across Ontario. It is used by election staff to verify whether voters are eligible to vote in a given election or by-election.
